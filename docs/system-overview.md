## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

### Technology Stack
**Core Language:** IBM COBOL  
**Transaction Processor:** IBM CICS (Customer Information Control System)  
**Primary Data Store:** VSAM KSDS (Key-Sequenced Dataset) with Alternate Indexes  
**Batch Engine:** JCL (Job Control Language) with utility programs and COBOL batch programs  
**Security:** RACF (Resource Access Control Facility)  
**System Programming:** IBM Assembler (MVSWAIT, COBDATFT utilities)

**Optional Extensions:**  
- **DB2:** Transaction Type Management; Fraud Analytics  
- **IMS DB:** Hierarchical store for authorization data (HIDAM)  
- **IBM MQ:** Authorization request/response; Account extraction

### Architectural Patterns
- **CICS Transaction Pattern:** Each online function is mapped to a CICS transaction ID → COBOL program → BMS map (3270 screen). Programs pass state via COMMAREA.
- **Batch Pipeline:** Sequential JCL jobs read/write VSAM files, produce reports, calculate interest, and post transactions.
- **Optional MQ Trigger:** COPAUA0C is triggered by MQ message arrival (CP00 transaction) to process card authorization requests asynchronously.
- **Copybook-Driven Data Access:** Shared copybooks (e.g., CVACT01Y, CVCUS01Y) define VSAM record layouts used across online and batch programs.
- **COMMAREA State Management:** CICS programs pass navigation state (current program, next program, account/card IDs) via COCOM01Y copybook-defined COMMAREA.

### 1. Authentication
**ID:** `authentication`  
**Purpose:** Controls user sign-on and access to the CardDemo application. Validates credentials against the USRSEC VSAM file and routes users to appropriate menus based on user type (regular/admin).  
**Key Components:**
- `COSGN00C` – CICS COBOL signon program
- `COSGN00` / `COSGN00.bms` – BMS 3270 signon screen (mapset)
- `CSUSR01Y.cpy` – User security record layout
- USRSEC VSAM file (`AWS.M2.CARDDEMO.USRSEC.PS`)

**CICS Transactions:**
| Transaction | Program  | Function |
|:-----------|:---------|:---------|
| CC00       | COSGN00C | Display signon screen and authenticate user |

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User enters User ID (8 chars) and Password (8 chars) on CC00 screen
2. COSGN00C reads USRSEC VSAM file with user ID as key
3. Password is compared; user type (`SEC-USR-TYPE`) determines routing
4. Admin users → Admin Menu (CA00); Regular users → Main Menu (CM00)

**User Story Examples:**
- As a **cardholder**, I want to sign in with my user ID and password so I can access account management functions.
- As an **administrator**, I want to sign in with elevated credentials so I can access admin-only functions.
- As a **security auditor**, I want failed login attempts to display error messages so unauthorized access is prevented.

```

**Dependencies:**
- Upstream: `authentication` (signon required), `accounts` (ACCTDAT VSAM for CT02 validation), `credit-cards` (CARDXREF for card→account lookup)
- Downstream: `reports` (CBTRN03C), `bill-payment` (writes payment transactions to TRANSACT), `batch-processing` (TCATBALF consumed by interest calculation)
- Optional: `transaction-type-db2` manages the type codes referenced by TRAN-TYPE-CD

**Business Rules:**
- TRAN-ID is a 16-character unique key; COTRN02C generates it at add-time; CBTRN02C uses DALYTRAN-ID
- CBTRN02C validates card number (reason 100 = not in XREFFILE) then account (reason 101 = not in ACCTFILE); rejects go to DALYREJS with RC=4
- CBTRN02C updates TCATBAL category-balance buckets for each accepted transaction — critical for CBACT04C interest calculation
- TRANIDX (AIX rebuild) must run after POSTTRAN to keep card-number lookups accurate
- CBTRN03C report filters by TRAN-PROC-TS date range supplied via DATEPARM file
- CBEXPORT/CBIMPORT include transactions as part of full customer-profile migration records

CREATE TABLE CARDDEMO.TRANSACTION_TYPE (
    TR_TYPE         CHAR(2)       NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    TR_DESCRIPTION  VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE CARDDEMO.TRANSACTION_TYPE_CATEGORY (
    TRC_TYPE_CODE     CHAR(2)  NOT NULL,
    TRC_TYPE_CATEGORY CHAR(4)  NOT NULL,
    TRC_CAT_DATA      VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (TRC_TYPE_CODE, TRC_TYPE_CATEGORY),
    FOREIGN KEY (TRC_TYPE_CODE) REFERENCES TRANSACTION_TYPE(TR_TYPE) ON DELETE RESTRICT
);
```

**DB2 Integration Patterns Demonstrated:**
- Static embedded SQL with COBOL host variables
- Forward and backward cursor processing for paged listings
- CRUD (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE) with SQLCA error handling
- Proper COMMIT/ROLLBACK in CICS environment
- DB2 precompiler integration

**User Story Examples:**
- As an **admin**, I want to add new transaction types so new categories of charges can be processed.
- As an **admin**, I want to update transaction type descriptions so reference data is accurate.
- As an **admin**, I want to delete obsolete transaction types (with referential integrity check) so old codes are retired.
- As a **batch operator**, I want transaction type data synchronized from DB2 to VSAM so online processing uses current reference data.

### 11. MQ Integration
**ID:** `mq-integration`  
**Purpose:** Optional extension demonstrating IBM MQ request/response patterns for asynchronous system date and account data inquiry via CICS transactions.  
**Key Components:**
- `CODATE01` – System date inquiry via MQ (CDRD transaction)
- `COACCT01` – Account details inquiry via MQ (CDRA transaction)
- MQ Queues: `CARDDEMO.REQUEST.QUEUE` / `CARDDEMO.RESPONSE.QUEUE`

**CICS Transactions:**
| Transaction | Program  | Function |
|:-----------|:---------|:---------|
| CDRD       | CODATE01 | Inquire system date via MQ request/response |
| CDRA       | COACCT01 | Inquire account details via MQ |

**MQ Message Formats:**

*Date Request:*
```cobol
01 DATE-REQUEST-MSG.
    05 REQUEST-TYPE  PIC X(4) VALUE 'DATE'.
    05 REQUEST-ID    PIC X(8).
```

*Account Request:*
```cobol
01 ACCT-REQUEST-MSG.
    05 REQUEST-TYPE    PIC X(4) VALUE 'ACCT'.
    05 REQUEST-ID      PIC X(8).
    05 ACCOUNT-NUMBER  PIC X(11).
```

**User Story Examples:**
- As an **integration developer**, I want to retrieve the system date via MQ so external systems can synchronize time.
- As an **integration developer**, I want to query account details over MQ so distributed systems can access account data asynchronously.
- As a **modernization architect**, I want to understand the MQ request/response pattern so I can expose services in a modern API layer.

## 📋 Business Rules by Module

### Authentication — Rules
- User ID and password are required fields (no blank accepted)
- Credentials validated against USRSEC VSAM file (FB, 80 bytes)
- Failed authentication displays error message; no lockout implemented in base app
- User type determines post-login destination: `A`→Admin Menu (CA00), `U`→Main Menu (CM00)
- Default credentials: ADMIN001/PASSWORD (admin), USER0001/PASSWORD (regular user)

### Accounts — Rules
- Account ID is 11-digit numeric; unique across system
- Active status must be `A` to allow transaction processing
- Credit limit enforced: new transactions rejected if they would exceed `ACCT-CREDIT-LIMIT`
- Interest calculated using `ACCT-GROUP-ID` to look up rates in DISCGRP/TCATBALF files
- Account balance updated atomically during batch posting

### Credit Cards — Rules
- Card number is 16 characters; linked to exactly one account via CARDXREF
- Multiple cards can be linked to a single account
- Card status `A`=Active enables transactions; `I`=Inactive prevents new charges
- Expiration date must be checked during authorization processing
- CVV is stored but not encrypted in the base application (modernization consideration)

### Transactions — Rules
- Transaction ID is 16-character unique key in TRANSACT VSAM
- Transaction amount must be non-zero
- Transaction type code must exist in TRANTYPE reference file (or DB2 TRANSACTION_TYPE)
- Daily transaction file (DALYTRAN) is the source for batch posting
- AIX (Alternate Index) on TRANSACT allows lookup by card number

### Bill Payment — Rules
- Payment amount must be greater than zero
- Payment creates a debit transaction in the TRANSACT VSAM file
- Account `ACCT-CURR-BAL` decremented by payment amount
- `ACCT-CURR-CYC-CREDIT` incremented

### Reports — Rules
- Report generation is triggered online (CR00) and executed as a batch job via internal reader
- Transaction reports cover a specified date range
- Statements are stored in GDG (Generation Data Group) — one generation per billing cycle
- GDG retention managed by DEFGDGB/DEFGDGD JCL jobs

### Authorization (Optional) — Rules
- MQ request must conform to CSV format; malformed messages are rejected
- Authorization uses VSAM cross-reference to link card number to account
- Credit availability checked before approval; declined if insufficient credit
- IMS HIDAM database stores authorization summary (root) and details (child segment)
- Fraud marking (COPAUS2C) inserts into DB2 AUTHFRDS table; requires two-phase commit across IMS and DB2
- Batch purge (CBPAUP0J) removes expired authorizations and restores available credit

### User Management — Rules
- Only admin users (`SEC-USR-TYPE = 'A'`) can access user management functions
- User ID (8 chars) is the VSAM primary key; must be unique
- Password is stored in USRSEC file (not hashed in base application — modernization consideration)
- Deleting a user is immediate; no soft-delete or audit trail in base application

## 🎯 Patterns for User Stories

### CICS Online Story Pattern
```
As a [cardholder | admin | operator],
I want to [perform action on 3270 screen / transaction XXXX],
So that [business value].

Acceptance Criteria:
- GIVEN I am signed in as [user type]
- WHEN I navigate to [transaction / menu option]
- AND I [enter data / press PF key]
- THEN the system [displays / updates / creates] [entity]
- AND [confirmation message / updated balance / record written to VSAM]
```

### Batch Job Story Pattern
```
As a [batch operator | operations manager],
I want [JCL job JOBNAME] to [process action],
So that [business value].

Acceptance Criteria:
- GIVEN the prerequisite files are in place (VSAM files closed/open as needed)
- WHEN [JOBNAME] is submitted
- THEN [PROGRAM] reads [input file] and writes [output file]
- AND job completes with return code 0
- AND [VSAM/GDG/report output] reflects the expected results
```

### Story Complexity Guidelines

| Complexity | Points | Examples |
|:----------|:------|:--------|
| Simple | 1–2 | Add/update a single screen field; read-only display changes; copybook structure addition |
| Medium | 3–5 | New CICS transaction with BMS map; batch job modification; DB2 cursor query change |
| Complex | 5–8 | New MQ integration; IMS segment addition; multi-file batch pipeline; cross-system two-phase commit |
| Epic | 8+ | New module (e.g., rewards system); major architectural addition (new DB2 schema + CICS transactions + batch) |

### Acceptance Criteria Patterns

**Authentication:**
- Must validate user ID and password against USRSEC VSAM
- Must route admin users to CA00, regular users to CM00
- Must display error message for invalid credentials

**Account/Card Updates:**
- Must read current record from VSAM before update
- Must validate all fields (no spaces in required fields)
- Must write updated record back to VSAM
- Must display confirmation message upon success

**Transaction Processing:**
- Must validate transaction type code against reference data
- Must verify sufficient available credit before approval
- Must update account balance and cycle totals atomically

**Batch Jobs:**
- Must complete with return code 0 for success
- Must handle VSAM record-not-found conditions gracefully (return code 4 = no data, not error)
- Must produce correct record counts in job log

**MQ Integration:**
- Must correlate request and response messages using REQUEST-ID
- Must handle timeout condition if no response received
- Must log errors if MQ operation fails

---

## ⚡ Performance Budgets

- **CICS Screen Response:** < 2 seconds (typical 3270 interaction)
- **VSAM Random Read:** < 50ms (keyed access, KSDS)
- **Batch POSTTRAN throughput:** designed for thousands of transactions per run
- **MQ Authorization Response:** < 5 seconds (synchronous request/reply via MQ)
- **DB2 Cursor Queries:** < 500ms for paged transaction type listings

---

## 🚨 Readiness Considerations

### Technical Risks
- **Password Storage:** Passwords stored in plain text in USRSEC VSAM → Modernization should implement hashing
- **CVV Storage:** CVV codes stored unencrypted in CARDDATA → PCI-DSS compliance risk
- **No Lockout:** Authentication has no account lockout after failed attempts → Brute-force vulnerability
- **Two-Phase Commit (Auth):** IMS+DB2 two-phase commit requires careful transaction management → Test thoroughly
- **EBCDIC Data:** Sample data is in EBCDIC format → Requires binary transfer to mainframe

### Tech Debt
- **Multiple coding styles:** Application intentionally uses varied COBOL patterns across programs → Be consistent in new code
- **Hardcoded credentials:** Default ADMIN001/PASSWORD → Must change in any non-demo environment
- **FILLER fields:** Copybooks include filler bytes → Available for future field additions without record-length change

### Sequencing for User Stories
- **Prerequisites:** Authentication module must work before any other module can be accessed
- **Recommended order:** authentication → accounts → credit-cards → transactions → bill-payment → reports → user-management → batch-processing → (optional) authorization → transaction-type-db2 → mq-integration

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Adoption
- **Target:** All user types (cardholder, admin, operator) can complete their primary workflows without errors
- **Engagement:** Transaction volume processed per batch cycle; screen transactions per day
- **Retention:** Zero critical batch job failures per month

### Business Impact
- **Account Accuracy:** Account balances must match sum of posted transactions ± interest calculations
- **Authorization Rate:** Authorization approval/decline decisions logged 100% in IMS DB
- **Fraud Detection:** Fraudulent transactions marked in DB2 within same business day
